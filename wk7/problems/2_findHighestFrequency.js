/*******************************************************************************
Write a function findHighestFrequency that takes in an object and returns an object with the key that has the highest value. With this function we can see which word appeared in the sentence with the highest frequency.

If there is a tie between the two most frequent words, the first appearing one is returned.

Examples:

findHighestFrequency( { that: 4, is: 4, not: 2 } ) => { that: 4 }
findHighestFrequency( { hi: 1 } ) => { hi: 1 }
*******************************************************************************/

function findHighestFrequency(freqObject) {
  // your code here...
}
