/******************************************************************************
Write a function findWordFrequencies that takes in a sentence (string), and returns an object with each word as a key, with a value of how many times that word appears in the sentence.

eg: { I: 1, love: 1, lamp: 1 }

Make it work just for sentences without commas, apostrophes, and periods. Capital letters and lowercase letters should be treated as equals: 'The' and 'the' are the same word.

Examples:

findWordFrequencies('The world is all that is the case') => { the: 2, world: 1, is: 2, all: 1, that: 1, case: 1 }

findWordFrequencies('That that is is that that is not is not') => { that: 4, is: 4, not: 2 }
*******************************************************************************/

function findWordFrequencies(array) {
  // your code here...
}
